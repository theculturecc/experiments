<!--
  White Space consistency:
  - adjust the Logo view box so there is almost no top/bottom padding
  - add an empty <p /> tag to have the same responsive margin as other paragraphs
  - write the description of the system inside an HTML comment (isn't that awesome?!)
-->

<Logo width="50%" viewBox="0 190 800 220" />

Welcome to The Culture,<br />
a creative collective <br />
